# gotofun

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to use [PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com/)
to build an offline-first Flutter app with a Rails backend.

The app is a simple app that provides a list of fun things to do. It also provides some scaffolding for adding new items,
building a UI for this is left as an exercise for the reader.

The app is built with Flutter, and the backend is built with Rails.

## Setup

1. Deploy the Rails app to a server somewhere. I used Fly.io.
2. Deploy the Flutter app to a device or emulator.
3. Read the individual READMEs for the app and backend for detailed information.
